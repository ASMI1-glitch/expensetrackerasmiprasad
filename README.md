Getting Started with This React Application
This project was set up using Create React App, a popular tool for initializing React applications.

Available Commands
In the project directory, you can execute the following commands:

npm start
Launches the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it.

The page will automatically reload when you save changes.
You might also see any linting errors in the console.

npm test
Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.
Refer to the documentation on running tests for more information.

npm run build
Compiles the app for production, generating output in the build folder.
This command optimizes the app for performance and correctly bundles React for production use.

The production build is minified, and the filenames include hashes for cache busting.
Your app is now ready for deployment!

See the deployment section in the documentation for more details.

npm run eject
Caution: This is a permanent action. Once you eject, you cannot revert!

If you need more control over the build configuration, you can eject at any time. This will remove the single build dependency from your project.

It will also copy all configuration files and dependencies (such as Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project directory, granting you complete control over them. All remaining commands will continue to function but will point to the copied scripts for customization. At this stage, you're responsible for maintaining the configuration.

Ejecting is not necessary for most projects, and the curated feature set is typically sufficient for small to medium-sized applications. However, we understand the need for customization as your project evolves.
